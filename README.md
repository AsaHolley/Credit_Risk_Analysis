# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis ##
In this project we used a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to use supervised machine learning to review credit risk. In the project we oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and under-sampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we used a combinatorial approach of over- and under-sampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Finally we compared two new machine learning models that are used to reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, in the analysis.
